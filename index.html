      <h3>##Who I Am<br /></h3>
      <p>sulaiman awfa<br />
      Currently enrolled as a software engineering student at HELICO school of
      computer technology.<br />
      **Expected Graduation:** [2025]<br>
      <br> # My Journey into Software Engineering

      <br>My journey into the world of software engineering began with a significant
      decision. I made the choice to follow my passion for coding and technology
      by leaving my engineering education at Addis Ababa Science and Technology
      University. It was a leap of faith that led me to enroll at Helico School
      of Computer Technology, where I could pursue my dream of becoming a
      software engineer.
      <br />
      ## Early Questions and Determination
      <br />
      As I continued my education at Helico School, I found myself pondering a
      crucial question:<br />
      Did I have to wait until I completed my degree to start my career in
      software development? The desire to be financially independent and support
      my education led me to seek opportunities to gain practical experience.
      <br />
      ## Pursuing Full-Stack Development
      <br />
      I soon discovered that while some of the courses I had started might
      require me to reach the third year of my program, I had the potential to
      learn full-stack development independently. This realization marked the
      beginning of my journey to become a full-stack developer.
      <br />
      ## Developing My Skills
      <br />
      With a strong foundation in algorithmic thinking and proficiency in C++, I
      decided to expand my skill set. I began my exploration of Java and delved
      into various engineering courses that would provide me with the knowledge
      base necessary for full-stack development.
      <br> ## Ready for Real-World<br>
      Challenges Today, I am not only an advanced C++ programmer but also a
      dedicated learner, eager to tackle real-world problems and create
      innovative solutions. My journey from engineering to software development
      has equipped me with the skills and mindset required to excel in the
      field. As I continue to grow and learn, I look forward to applying my
      knowledge to real-world projects, gaining valuable experience, and
      evolving into a seasoned software developer. Thank you for joining me on
      my journey in software engineering.<br> ## What Drives Me <br>
      What truly motivates me as a software engineer is the potential to make a meaningful impact on
      the world. Whether it's developing an efficient algorithm, creating an
      intuitive user interface, or collaborating with a team to solve complex
      challenges, I am driven by the belief that technology can be a force for
      positive change.<br>
       ## My Approach <br>
       I approach each project with a blend of
      creativity and analytical thinking. I love diving deep into
      problem-solving, breaking down complex problems into manageable
      components, and crafting elegant solutions. I am also a firm believer in
      the importance of continuous learning, staying updated with industry
      trends, and expanding my skill set. <br>## Beyond Code Outside of coding<br> I am
      a big fan of martial arts and football. These
      activities provide me with a well-rounded perspective that often inspires
      my work in unexpected ways.
